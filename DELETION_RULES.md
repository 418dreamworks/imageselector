# Deletion Rules

1. NEVER delete, remove, or modify any file or directory without explicitly asking the user first.
2. Always ask for confirmation TWICE (two separate confirmations) before executing any deletion. The ONLY acceptable confirmation is the word "YES" in all caps. Any other response (yes, y, ok, sure, do it, etc.) does NOT count as confirmation.
3. Do not interpret any user statement as implicit consent to delete. The user must explicitly type "YES" (all caps) for each of the two confirmations.
4. Before proposing a deletion, verify what will be affected (e.g., check if software is installed before assuming a folder is leftover data).
5. Never fabricate or assume facts about what is or isn't installed — always check first.
6. Any operation involving more than 500 MB of data — whether move, copy, or delete — must be treated as a deletion-level operation and requires explicit two-layer permission (two separate confirmations) before executing.
