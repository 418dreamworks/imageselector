Item is in a \u201ckit\u201d format and they held the order until I received the fabric samples and made my selection. \n\nOnly thing not understood is that the side panels going down the length of the bed are in 2 pieces and it was difficult to discern that from the photos provided (photos need to provide that transparency). \n\nOverall, very happy with the purchase. It was important to me to be able to get the right color tone on the fabric and the way the store operates, that was accomplished. \n\nI would suggest the company create small booklets of fabric samples because the cost of the fabric samples was a little high.  Or they could included a return envelope and simply have the customer return the samples after selection.", "language": "en", "create_timestamp": 1767735211}]
